              <p>I am an artist and musician that stumbled into the bar business. It is the love of what I do that makes me an artisan. Today, thanks to this class, I take better care of the systems that support my bar. Thank you, Holly, for making me understand that being poor doesn’t make me more authentic. It just makes me poor. And although money still is not my primary motivation, you helped me recognize that it is a necessary tool to keep my business healthy.  I am proud to think financially and to not just pretend the scary “business of business” doesn’t exist and hope for the best. On the days when sisyphean tasks pile up, you start to wonder where your freedom went. Now, because of this class, I have lots of obvious goals that pull me out of that day-to-day and keep me excited about the future.  </p>

            <p>We met with Holly Howard when our business was just a glimmer of an idea. She was our trusted guide through the entire process of developing our business plan, through to the early days of hiring and opening our bookshop. Her warmth, wisdom, expertise, vast connections in the small business community, as well as her faith in our mission, and encouragement, was invaluable to us as we shaped our glimmer into something concrete. We quite simply could not have opened Stories in the time frame in which we did it, without Holly's help.</p>
