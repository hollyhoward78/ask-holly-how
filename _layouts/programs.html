          <p class="lead">Growing a business requires a totally different skill set than founding one. The tools and knowledge an entrepreneur may have used to launch their company are wholly different from what they’ll need to successfully operate and scale it. Sometimes this unfortunate reality is quickly apparent; other times a business limps by for years without any clear structures or systems for growth.</p>
          <p class="lead p-xs-t-1">That's where this program comes in. Business Growth for Creative Entrepreneurs addresses the philosophical and practical challenges creative entrepreneurs face in both b2b and b2c settings. Using a customizable framework—not a one-size-fits-all formula—the program reveals the skills needed to grow your business successfully, whether that means expanding an e-commerce startup, growing a lifestyle business, globalizing a service-based company, or moving into a brick and mortar space.</p>
          <p class="lead p-xs-t-1">Put simply, this program provides the chance to stop being reactive and start being proactive about growth. Whether you're scaling for an exit or building towards a legacy, Business Growth for Creative Entrepreneurs will teach you how to define or refine your company culture  and operationalize it for growth. In an economy where culture speaks louder than brand, and values create greater connections than algorithms, this is the program that puts you on the path to creative freedom and financial well-being while fostering greater internal company cohesion as well as customer reciprocity.</p>
