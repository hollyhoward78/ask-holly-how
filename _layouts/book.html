            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The artisan economy is one of the fastest growing segments in the United States and is responsible for regenerating post-industrial urban landscapes in America.  This sector, where products are influenced by the cultural traditions of the community within which they are produced, stands out from its industrial predecessors by emphasizing personal touch.   This book is a mix of thought leadership and instruction. It is the how-to guide for the emerging artisan economy and more.  It will outline how today’s entrepreneurs can ensure a successful venture as the economy vacillates between recovery and recession, how they can create an honest, unique identity in an era of such rapid innovation and change, how they can stand out in a saturated marketplace when we now have more innovators and makers than ever before, how they can bring together and lead a devoted team when so many workers are eyeing the gig economy and they themselves have no experience managing others, and how they can bring their vision to life and find confidence in their role as leaders of this new economic moment.
