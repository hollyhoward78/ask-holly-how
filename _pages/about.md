      text: Running a small business is incredibly rewarding yet challenging and often
        lonely for its leader. Over the course of the years working with Holly,
        I realized that she has an un-matched ability to embrace and understand
        deeply all aspects of what it takes to be an entrepreneur and therefore,
        she is truly able to assist me through not only the lows, but the highs
        that came with the task. It takes incredible strength and
        self-exploration in her part to master that in a way that is not only
        empowering but no intrusive in what must stay the leader's process to
        achieve his goals. And she does it always with a smile...

      text: Working with Holly transformed my business and helped me to become a
        better manager. Holly helped me prioritize my time and energy to become
        more efficient and a more savvy sales person of our services. She helped
        me to take a hard look at our numbers and make the right decisions to
        shed the parts of our business that weren't working and focus on those
        that were. Working with Holly helped me to get a better understanding of
        how we could be more profitable and what kinds of clients we should be
        targeting to grow our business while also helping me understand what
        kind of staffing I'd need to put in place to reach my goals. She also
        made introductions to financing partners to help expand our business and
        other local business with aligned interests. Working with Holly over the
        course of two years doubled our revenue and made me a much more
        effective manager. I can not recommend her services highly enough!

      name: Sara Berks
      text: Working with Holly these past four years has been a business and life
        changing experience. She has a way of understanding the person behind
        the 'business owner,' and guiding them to know and understand their own
        strengths and embrace their weaknesses. We've worked on everything from
        Business Planning to Infrastructure Development, Culture Change,
        Marketing, Financial Planning, and Executive Coaching. She also joined
        my team on our first team retreat, guiding us in a workshop for goal
        setting for the next year, and a few years later leading us through a
        communication workshop after we experienced a lot of change, growth, and
        transition. Sometimes I joke that a guiding principle of how I lead is
        'What Would Holly Do,' but it's honestly really true. Holly has taught
        me to slow down and pause before jumping into problem solving, the
        importance of structure, and that difficult conversations can only lead
        to better.

        guidance and support, we've learned to keep perspective on the countless
        small tasks calling out for our attention on a daily basis, and focus
        ample time and energy on developing processes and systems that will
        allow us to continue growing into a calm, stable, mature company. We've
        worked with her on business planning, infrastructure development,
        personnel systems, financial planning, and marketing planning. Her
        approach is holistic, and grounded in a framework that always goes back
        to our core values. It makes it easy to know when we're being true to
        our vision, when we might have strayed, and how to course-correct. More
        than anything, working with Holly has been empowering. She has set us up
        to trust ourselves, know when to seek outside guidance, and continue
        charting a self-directed path for healthy growth, both personally and
        professionally.  "

        business has tripled in size and raised $4M. But what I have found most
        valuable is my improved values alignment. She helps you stay grounded so
        everything else can soar.

        “Hands down, Holly. She changed my life.” And it’s true. Holly has been
        my guardian angel in exploring, finding, and cementing the mission,
        values, and culture at Daly in its many iterations. We have built
        operational systems together, hiring plans, financial models, growth
        paths, dream client lists, and so much more. Holly isn’t just a
        consultant, she has been a partner and a friend, and with her guidance,
        we have almost grown by 40% in size and revenue in just the last year. I
        am grateful that I found her, and am lucky to be on this continued
        career journey with her."

        support. Through Infrastructure Support and Financial Planning (among

        year working together. Her Executive Coaching ensures that I have the
        skills I need moving forward to think outside the box and maintain
        profitability. Holly is an invaluable advisor of the Wooden Spoon
        ecosystem. She is the best in the business.

      text: The Business Growth Program shifted everything. I was just going along bit
        by bit before the class and wasn't looking at my business with a bigger
        plan and goal. I started to have a process for vetting these bigger
        ideas and figuring out how to make them attainable. It made me realize
        that my job was to not just create the product but to create the
        business, the company, the culture. I had to think bigger—and actually
        more personally. Figuring out values that were important to me
        personally, but relevant to what we were doing was a huge step. Getting
        clear on that made it easier to think about what kind of company I
        wanted to build, what experience I wanted for our customers, and also
        for my employees."

      text: "We began working with Holly at a pivotal moment in our retail business
        when we were unsure about important next steps - selling, closing,
        expanding  or re-envisioning.  We needed to delineate and evaluate our
        best options.  Holly provided the direction and a platform for
        exploration that allowed us to discover what our strongest and most
        effective paths ahead were, inspiring us to rethink our next careers
        based on our skill sets despite the scary unknowns that were part of
        that decision.  Ultimately, she helped guide us through the structure
        and terms of the sale of our business that allowed us to pursue and
        achieve quality of life goals. She gave us the tools to build new
        business models and encouraged the questions that brought us the clarity
        to make our most informed decisions.  Most of all she is the team member
        we’d always wanted: smart, engaged, and a force for bringing out the
        best in you by building on your strengths."

        butcher shop in town, mostly fueled by beer and whiskey. However, we
        didn’t take the time to focus on the structure of our business, and the
        organization we were creating. Holly helped us define our roles and
        responsibilities, clarify our relationships, be better leaders, and get
        on the same page. Our shop is now managed better, with clear managerial
        roles, and expectations. Everyone’s job easier just knowing what is
        expected of them, and how they can succeed. Now we’re drinking to relax,
        rather than out of stress.

        love of what I do that makes me an artisan. Today, thanks to this class,
        I take better care of the systems that support my bar. Thank you, Holly,
        for making me understand that being poor doesn’t make me more authentic.
        It just makes me poor. And although money still is not my primary
        motivation, you helped me recognize that it is a necessary tool to keep
        my business healthy. I am proud to think financially and to not just
        pretend the scary “business of business” doesn’t exist and hope for the
        best. On the days when sisyphean tasks pile up, you start to wonder
        where your freedom went. Now, because of this class, I have lots of
        obvious goals that pull me out of that day-to-day and keep me excited
        about the future.

      text: When we first met Holly we were exhausted and struggling to grow our
        company and growing afraid of what might happen next. Holly helped us
        get to the bottom of and resolve the fears that were blocking us. With
        her mentorship, we were able to refine our vision and values, and
        restore our enthusiasm and confidence to move forward with inner clarity
        and ambition. Over time Holly has helped us reflect on and improve
        almost every aspect of our business and culture — from our pricing model
        to our hiring practices. In the two years since we began working with
        Holly, we’ve almost doubled our sales (despite a pandemic in the
        middle), achieved profitability. More significantly, the health of our
        company culture has transformed, benefiting our employees, our
        customers, and ourselves. Holly achieves all this through asking the
        right questions, as opposed to giving rote answers. Perhaps the most
        brilliant thing about our work with Holly is a genuine sense that we
        have grown as humans in the process. We are now better equipped to run
        our business in future, and on a deeper level, to navigate the
        complexity of our own personal lives.

      name: St. John Frizell
      text: I met Holly Howard in 2013, when Fort Defiance, my restaurant in Brooklyn,
        was at a crossroads. We were still recovering from Hurricane Sandy,
        burdened with debt, and I was exhausted. Holly showed me that I wasn't
        alone — that there were lots of creatives like me trapped in businesses
        they started that they didn't know how to run properly — and that there
        was hope for all of us. Under Holly's tutelage, Fort Defiance became a
        powerhouse, increasing revenue and profit year after year. She
        introduced me to ways of thinking about business that were entirely new,
        and converted me from a frustrated bartender into an efficient operator.
        I opened the restaurant Gage & Tollner in 2021, and thanks to Holly's
        advice on securing investment, creating culture, and sound business
        planning, we raised $1.3M in private equity and close to $500K in
        regulation crowdfunding, and the business is now a wild success.

        former business Greenpointers. All small business owners should think
        about a business plan and GET HELP! Working with her gave me confidence
        and showed me the true value of all my hard work. It also increased the
        profit of my sale to almost double of an offer I received before working
        with her! When I come up with another business idea she is the first
        person I am going to call!
