          Running a small business is incredibly rewarding yet challenging and
          often lonely for its leader. Over the course of the years working with
          Holly, I realized that she has an un-matched ability to embrace and
          understand deeply all aspects of what it takes to be an entrepreneur
          and therefore, she is truly able to assist me through not only the
          lows, but the highs that came with the task. It takes incredible
          strength and self-exploration in her part to master that in a way that
          is not only empowering but no intrusive in what must stay the leader's
          process to achieve his goals. And she does it always with a smile...

          Working with Holly transformed my business and helped me to become a
          better manager. Holly helped me prioritize my time and energy to
          become more efficient and a more savvy sales person of our services.
          She helped me to take a hard look at our numbers and make the right
          decisions to shed the parts of our business that weren't working and
          focus on those that were. Working with Holly helped me to get a better
          understanding of how we could be more profitable and what kinds of
          clients we should be targeting to grow our business while also helping
          me understand what kind of staffing I'd need to put in place to reach
          my goals. She also made introductions to financing partners to help
          expand our business and other local business with aligned interests.
          Working with Holly over the course of two years doubled our revenue
          and made me a much more effective manager. I can not recommend her
          services highly enough!

          Like many small business owners, I have grown my business from the
          ground up. I often inadvertently skipped steps along the way. This
          class was an amazing opportunity that equipped me with knowledge and
          tools that helped me make positive changes within my company. I have a
          fresh set of eyes and a renewed sense of energy and excitement for the
          future.

          My experience in this program was instrumental. It helped me
          intelligently prepare my business to grow through forming a solid
          foundation. The topics were especially relevant, and included
          professional soul searching as well as more tactical, practical
          information. I highly recommend it to any business owner looking to
          tighten systems and learn how to become a better leader and overall
          happier business owner.

          The most valuable part of the From Artisan to Entrepreneur program was
          learning right along side other business owners within my community.
          It’s a rare opportunity to be able to have such frank conversations
          and get such beneficial feedback from my peers, all while fortifying
          the relationships within my community that help my business grow.
          Taking the From Artisan to Entrepreneur class pulled me out of the
          hyper-adrenaline, day-to-day mode of running a business and shed light
          on problems I wasn’t addressing and needed to overcome. The supportive
          community within the class allowed me to feel confident and
          accountable in recognizing those problems and the program gave me the
          solutions to solve them.

          We’ve operated like a loosely organized club for so long; without
          systems, without rules, without clear direction. Holly has a clear
          gift for immediately pinpointing simple shifts to alleviate the chaos
          and hangups that so many of us experience in small creative
          businesses. It’s like magic. Thanks to her From Artisan to
          Entrepreneur class, Saipua now has a very clearly defined vision with
          specific goals that keep the whole team on that path. We have shifted
          our company culture from one of martyrdom and exhaustion to one of
          enthusiasm and joy.

          In a time where my company was in transition, I reached out to Holly
          for help in figuring out what I really wanted and needed to keep the
          business going and in a new direction. She really took the time to
          understand my business—doing industry research and offering useful
          information that I hadn’t thought about already. One of the most
          eye-opening pieces of info I gained was discovering what I truly
          wanted out of my business. I had become so caught up in the
          day-to-day, I had lost sight of WHY I was doing what I was doing.
          Holly gave me the tools to help me define “why” I do what I do which
          ultimately helped me expand my business. And in the short time we
          worked together, I was able to rejuvenate my branding, logo, website
          and overall mindset of how to make things work better for me. She
          truly went above and beyond to make it happen!

          I think one of the most important lessons I took away from the Artisan
          to Entrepreneur class is that our small business (like one’s art) is a
          reflection of who we are and can’t be something we are not. The
          ambivalence I’ve felt toward being a businesswoman, (no, it was utter
          disdain) has dissipated and I just see it as a creative venture.

          As a small business owner, I often feel like my to-do list is endless
          and that I’m struggling to keep up instead of forging ahead. Desperate
          for help, I reached out to Holly Howard and am so pleased I did. Holly
          helped me organize, prioritize and take action. I was so impressed
          with her ability to quickly understand the issues I was facing,
          prioritize my tasks, and help me execute. Not only has my customer
          base and sales increased dramatically, but I feel in control of my
          business again. Holly’s support is priceless and I know that I will
          turn to her again and again as my business continues to grow and face
          new challenges. Thank you, Holly!

          When we started The Meat Hook, we focused our efforts on creating the
          best butcher shop in town, mostly fueled by beer and whiskey. However,
          we didn’t take the time to focus on the structure of our business, and
          the organization we were creating. Holly helped us define our roles
          and responsibilities, clarify our relationships, be better leaders,
          and get on the same page. Our shop is now managed better, with clear
          managerial roles, and expectations. Everyone’s job easier just knowing
          what is expected of them, and how they can succeed. Now we’re drinking
          to relax, rather than out of stress.

          The name of the course is From Artisan to Entrepreneur. I am an artist
          and musician that stumbled into the bar business. It is the love of
          what I do that makes me an artisan. Today, thanks to this class, I
          take better care of the systems that support my bar. Thank you, Holly,
          for making me understand that being poor doesn’t make me more
          authentic. It just makes me poor. And although money still is not my
          primary motivation, you helped me recognize that it is a necessary
          tool to keep my business healthy. I am proud to think financially and
          to not just pretend the scary “business of business” doesn’t exist and
          hope for the best. On the days when sisyphean tasks pile up, you start
          to wonder where your freedom went. Now, because of this class, I have
          lots of obvious goals that pull me out of that day-to-day and keep me
          excited about the future.

          I feel as though the From Artisan to Entrepreneur program is the thing
          that will make my business viable as a lifelong pursuit, allowing me
          to support a family with the creative work I’ve always loved. Before I
          took the class, I was content with the unpredictable and random growth
          of my practice, and very much focused only on the production of the
          immediate work at hand. The class helped me get a handle on the total
          picture of running a sustainable business and defining what success
          could and would actually look like. Holly’s clear, thoughtful and
          sensitive guidance has given me the confidence to define goals for my
          practice and to actually believe that they’re achievable. It’s
          incredible satisfying to have the business in the background of my
          design work feel as carefully considered as the work itself.

          We met with Holly Howard when our business was just a glimmer of an
          idea. She was our trusted guide through the entire process of
          developing our business plan, through to the early days of hiring and
          opening our bookshop. Her warmth, wisdom, expertise, vast connections
          in the small business community, as well as her faith in our mission,
          and encouragement, was invaluable to us as we shaped our glimmer into
          something concrete. We quite simply could not have opened Stories in
          the time frame in which we did it, without Holly's help.

          Big thanks to Ask Holly How for helping me create a selling plan for
          my former business Greenpointers.  All small business owners should
          think about a business plan and GET HELP! Working with her gave me
          confidence and showed me the true value of all my hard work. It also
          increased the profit of my sale to almost double of an offer I
          received before working with her! When I come up with another business
          idea she is the first person I am going to call!
