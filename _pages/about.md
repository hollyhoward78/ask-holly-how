    text: "The most valuable part of the From Artisan to Entrepreneur program was learning right along side other business owners within my community. It’s a rare opportunity to be able to have such frank conversations and get such beneficial feedback from my peers, all while fortifying the relationships within my community that help my business grow. Taking the From Artisan to Entrepreneur class pulled me out of the hyper-adrenaline, day-to-day mode of running a business and shed light on problems I wasn’t addressing and needed to overcome. The supportive community within the class allowed me to feel confident and accountable in recognizing those problems and the program gave me the solutions to solve them."
