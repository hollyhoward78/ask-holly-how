      text: Running a small business is incredibly rewarding yet challenging and often
        lonely for its leader. Over the course of the years working with Holly,
        I realized that she has an un-matched ability to embrace and understand
        deeply all aspects of what it takes to be an entrepreneur and therefore,
        she is truly able to assist me through not only the lows, but the highs
        that came with the task. It takes incredible strength and
        self-exploration in her part to master that in a way that is not only
        empowering but no intrusive in what must stay the leader's process to
        achieve his goals. And she does it always with a smile...

      text: Working with Holly transformed my business and helped me to become a
        better manager. Holly helped me prioritize my time and energy to become
        more efficient and a more savvy sales person of our services. She helped
        me to take a hard look at our numbers and make the right decisions to
        shed the parts of our business that weren't working and focus on those
        that were. Working with Holly helped me to get a better understanding of
        how we could be more profitable and what kinds of clients we should be
        targeting to grow our business while also helping me understand what
        kind of staffing I'd need to put in place to reach my goals. She also
        made introductions to financing partners to help expand our business and
        other local business with aligned interests. Working with Holly over the
        course of two years doubled our revenue and made me a much more
        effective manager. I can not recommend her services highly enough!

      text: Like many small business owners, I have grown my business from the ground
        up. I often inadvertently skipped steps along the way. This class was an
        amazing opportunity that equipped me with knowledge and tools that
        helped me make positive changes within my company. I have a fresh set of
        eyes and a renewed sense of energy and excitement for the future.

        prepare my business to grow through forming a solid foundation. The
        topics were especially relevant, and included professional soul
        searching as well as more tactical, practical information. I highly
        recommend it to any business owner looking to tighten systems and learn
        how to become a better leader and overall happier business owner.

        Holly has touched so many aspects of Dame. She has guided Dame through
        Business planning, cultural changes, infrastructure development,
        leadership development... and so much more.  Since working together my
        business has tripled in size and raised $4M. But what I have found most
        valuable is my improved values alignment. She helps you stay grounded so
        everything else can soar.

      text: "When peers ask me for business consultant recommendations, I tell them:
        “Hands down, Holly. She changed my life.” And it’s true. Holly has been
        my guardian angel in exploring, finding, and cementing the mission,
        values, and culture at Daly in its many iterations. We have built
        operational systems together, hiring plans, financial models, growth
        paths, dream client lists, and so much more. Holly isn’t just a
        consultant, she has been a partner and a friend, and with her guidance,
        we have almost grown by 40% in size and revenue in just the last year. I
        am grateful that I found her, and am lucky to be on this continued
        career journey with her."

      name: Megan Hill
      text: In a time where my company was in transition, I reached out to Holly for
        help in figuring out what I really wanted and needed to keep the
        business going and in a new direction. She really took the time to
        understand my business—doing industry research and offering useful
        information that I hadn’t thought about already. One of the most
        eye-opening pieces of info I gained was discovering what I truly wanted
        out of my business. I had become so caught up in the day-to-day, I had
        lost sight of WHY I was doing what I was doing. Holly gave me the tools
        to help me define “why” I do what I do which ultimately helped me expand
        my business. And in the short time we worked together, I was able to
        rejuvenate my branding, logo, website and overall mindset of how to make
        things work better for me. She truly went above and beyond to make it
        happen!

      name: Caroline Moore
      text: I think one of the most important lessons I took away from the Artisan to
        Entrepreneur class is that our small business (like one’s art) is a
        reflection of who we are and can’t be something we are not. The
        ambivalence I’ve felt toward being a businesswoman, (no, it was utter
        disdain) has dissipated and I just see it as a creative venture.

      text: As a small business owner, I often feel like my to-do list is endless and
        that I’m struggling to keep up instead of forging ahead. Desperate for
        help, I reached out to Holly Howard and am so pleased I did. Holly
        helped me organize, prioritize and take action. I was so impressed with
        her ability to quickly understand the issues I was facing, prioritize my
        tasks, and help me execute. Not only has my customer base and sales
        increased dramatically, but I feel in control of my business again.
        Holly’s support is priceless and I know that I will turn to her again
        and again as my business continues to grow and face new challenges.
        Thank you Holly!

      text: When we started The Meat Hook, we focused our efforts on creating the best
        butcher shop in town, mostly fueled by beer and whiskey. However, we
        didn’t take the time to focus on the structure of our business, and the
        organization we were creating. Holly helped us define our roles and
        responsibilities, clarify our relationships, be better leaders, and get
        on the same page. Our shop is now managed better, with clear managerial
        roles, and expectations. Everyone’s job easier just knowing what is
        expected of them, and how they can succeed. Now we’re drinking to relax,
        rather than out of stress.

      text: I am an artist and musician that stumbled into the bar business. It is the
        love of what I do that makes me an artisan. Today, thanks to this class,
        I take better care of the systems that support my bar. Thank you, Holly,
        for making me understand that being poor doesn’t make me more authentic.
        It just makes me poor. And although money still is not my primary
        motivation, you helped me recognize that it is a necessary tool to keep
        my business healthy. I am proud to think financially and to not just
        pretend the scary “business of business” doesn’t exist and hope for the
        best. On the days when sisyphean tasks pile up, you start to wonder
        where your freedom went. Now, because of this class, I have lots of
        obvious goals that pull me out of that day-to-day and keep me excited
        about the future.

      name: "Stephen Tracy and Harry Doull "
      text: When we first met Holly we were exhausted and struggling to grow our
        company and growing afraid of what might happen next. Holly helped us
        get to the bottom of and resolve the fears that were blocking us. With
        her mentorship, we were able to refine our vision and values, and
        restore our enthusiasm and confidence to move forward with inner clarity
        and ambition. Over time Holly has helped us reflect on and improve
        almost every aspect of our business and culture — from our pricing model
        to our hiring practices. In the two years since we began working with
        Holly, we’ve almost doubled our sales (despite a pandemic in the
        middle), achieved profitability. More significantly, the health of our
        company culture has transformed, benefiting our employees, our
        customers, and ourselves. Holly achieves all this through asking the
        right questions, as opposed to giving rote answers. Perhaps the most
        brilliant thing about our work with Holly is a genuine sense that we
        have grown as humans in the process. We are now better equipped to run
        our business in future, and on a deeper level, to navigate the
        complexity of our own personal lives.

      name: St. John Frizell
      text: I met Holly Howard in 2013, when Fort Defiance, my restaurant in Brooklyn,
        was at a crossroads. We were still recovering from Hurricane Sandy,
        burdened with debt, and I was exhausted. Holly showed me that I wasn't
        alone — that there were lots of creatives like me trapped in businesses
        they started that they didn't know how to run properly — and that there
        was hope for all of us. Under Holly's tutelage, Fort Defiance became a
        powerhouse, increasing revenue and profit year after year. She
        introduced me to ways of thinking about business that were entirely new,
        and converted me from a frustrated bartender into an efficient operator.
        I opened the restaurant Gage & Tollner in 2021, and thanks to Holly's
        advice on securing investment, creating culture, and sound business
        planning, we raised $1.3M in private equity and close to $500K in
        regulation crowdfunding, and the business is now a wild success.

      text: Big thanks to Ask Holly How for helping me create a selling plan for my
        former business Greenpointers. All small business owners should think
        about a business plan and GET HELP! Working with her gave me confidence
        and showed me the true value of all my hard work. It also increased the
        profit of my sale to almost double of an offer I received before working
        with her! When I come up with another business idea she is the first
        person I am going to call!
